The ThrowPropsPlugin.min.js file included here is just a dummy file.
The real plugin requires licensing from GreenSock. 
The plugin provides inertia on scrolling and map movement. 
The map will also work without it. 

If you don't have a license, delete the file and remove the 
link to it in the index.html

If you do have a licensed version, please put it here and replace the
dummy file.
